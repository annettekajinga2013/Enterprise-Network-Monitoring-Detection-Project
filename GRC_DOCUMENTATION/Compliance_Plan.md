COMPLIANCE LOG FORMAT REVIEW (POLICY)


1. PURPOSE

To establish a standardized log format and handling process across Splunk and Telisgate that ensures regulatory compliance, operational visibility, and incident response readiness.


2. SCOPE
Applies to all team A Members, system, application, network, and security logs collected within the enterprise environment. This includes, but is not limited to:
Firewalls, proxies, and intrusion detection/prevention systems
Authentication/identity systems (AD, SSO, MFA)
Business-critical applications and databases
Operating systems (Windows/Linux)
Cloud services and SaaS integrations


3. LOG FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
All logs must be structured with the following minimum fields, ensuring Splunk and Telisgate can parse and correlate them:

  Field																									Requirement

  Timestamp											ISO 8601 format with timezone (e.g., 2025-08-20T14:32:10Z)

  Event ID											Unique identifier for correlation

  Source System									Hostname or system identifier

  Source IP/Port               Network origin of the event

  Destination IP/Port           If applicable, target system or service

  User/Account                  Normalized identity field (userPrincipalName, UID, or ServiceAccount)

  Event Type                    Classification (e.g., authentication, data_access,config_change)

  Severity                      Standardized scale (e.g., Informational, Warning, Critical)

  Message/Details               Human-readable event details

  Compliance Tag                Regulatory mapping (e.g., PCI, HIPAA, SOX, ISO27001) if applicable Example (JSON format, Splunk-ready)


4. LOG COLLECTION & RENTENTION
Collection:
All logs must be forwarded in near real-time to Splunk and Telisgate.
Logs must use secure transport (TLS 1.2+).
No local log deletion until confirmed ingestion.
Retention:
Critical Security Logs: Minimum 12 months online, 7 years archived (regulatory alignment: PCI DSS, SOX).
Operational Logs: Minimum 90 days online, 12 months archived.
Archives must be encrypted and immutable (WORM or equivalent).


5. REVIEW & MONITORING
Daily automated correlation in Splunk and Telisgate for:

Privileged access
Authentication anomalies (failed logins, impossible travel)
Configuration changes
Data exfiltration patterns
Weekly manual sampling review by compliance/security team.

Quarterly compliance log audit cross-referenced against regulatory mappings.


6. INCIDENT RESPONSE & ESCALATION
Alerts generated by Splunk/Telisgate with severity Critical must trigger:
Immediate SOC notification
Escalation to compliance officer within 1 hour
Retention of related logs in a protected evidence repository


7. ROLE & RESPONSIBILITIES
System Owners: Ensure logging configuration aligns with format.
Team A Members: Monitor Splunk/Telisgate dashboards, escalate incidents.
Compliance Team: Conduct audits, map compliance tags, approve retention.


8. COMPLIANCE MAPPING
PCI DSS: Section 10 (log management)
HIPAA: Security Rule ยง164.312(b) (audit controls)
SOX: Section 404 (IT controls)
ISO 27001: Annex A.12.4 (logging and monitoring)
