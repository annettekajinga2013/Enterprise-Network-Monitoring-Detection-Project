1. PURPOSE

The purpose of this policy is to define acceptable use of the organization’s test network, including environments running Splunk and Telsicate. The test network exists solely for development, testing, troubleshooting, proof-of-concept (PoC) work, and training. It is not intended for production workloads or personal activities.


2. SCOPE

This policy applies to all Team A members, contractors, vendors, and authorized third parties who access the test network or its resources.


3. AUTHORIZED USE

Users must:

Access the test network only for approved testing, analytics, and development activities related to Splunk, Telsicate, and other authorized tools.

Use only data sets approved for testing (e.g., anonymized production data, synthetic data).

Follow approved testing procedures and document changes made in the environment.

Ensure Splunk and Telsicate are configured in a way that does not interfere with other systems or cause performance degradation.


4. PROHIBITED USE
Users must not:

Use the test network for personal projects, internet browsing, or non-work-related tasks.

Connect production data sources to Splunk or Telsicate without explicit written approval.

Perform unauthorized penetration testing, port scanning, or network sniffing.

Install unapproved applications, plugins, or scripts on Splunk, Telsicate, or other test systems.

Share credentials or allow unauthorized users to access the test network.

Export or move sensitive data from the test environment without approval.


5. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

Systems connecting to the test network must have current security patches and endpoint protection.

MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) must be used where available.

Test data must be reviewed for sensitive information before loading into Splunk or Telsicate.

All configurations, scripts, and test results must be stored in approved repositories.


6. MONITORING & PRIVACY

All activity on the test network, including Splunk and Telsicate usage, will be logged and monitored.

Team A members may review logs for compliance, troubleshooting, or security investigation purposes.

Users have no expectation of privacy when using the test network.


7. ENFORCEMENT

Violations may result in loss of test network access, disciplinary action, or termination.

Severe breaches may be escalated to legal or regulatory authorities.


8. REVIEW

This policy will be reviewed annually, or after any significant change to the test network, Splunk, or Telsicate usage.
