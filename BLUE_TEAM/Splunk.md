# Splunk â€“ Centralized SIEM Platform

## Purpose and Role
- **Centralized log aggregation, indexing, and analysis platform**  
- Collected, normalized, and correlated logs from **Suricata, Sysmon, Zeek, and Tailscale**  
- Enabled search, visualization, and alerting for **real-time detection and threat hunting**

---

## Key Functions

### Log Collection & Aggregation
- Ingested **Suricata EVE JSON alerts**
- Collected **Sysmon logs** from Windows endpoints via **Universal Forwarder**
- Integrated **Zeek/Tailscale logs via HTTP Event Collector**

### Real-time Event Correlation
- Linked **Suricata network alerts** to endpoint activity
- Used **SPL (Search Processing Language)** to correlate cross-source events

### Threat Detection
- Converted **Sigma rules into SPL queries**
- Detected **lateral movement, C2 traffic, and suspicious process executions**

### Visualization & Dashboards
- Dashboards for **network trends, Suricata alerts, and endpoint anomalies**
- Real-time visualization of:
  - **SSH brute-force attempts**
  - **DNS anomalies**
- **Alerts:**
  - Configured **email & Slack alerts** for critical events

## Limitations & Challenges
- High data volume from Suricata caused **storage strain**
- **Licensing limitations** (free tier capped at 500MB/day)
- Indexing delays during **peak hours**
- **False positives** in initial rule sets

---

## Outcomes
- Achieved **real-time detection of network threats**
- Reduced **investigation time by 40%** using correlated views
- Delivered a **reusable Splunk dashboard template** for enterprise use
